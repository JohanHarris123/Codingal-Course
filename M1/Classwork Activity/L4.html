    <h1>Lemons have alot of energy within them!</h1>
    <p>In this webpage, you will learn why lemons are called "natural batteries" because of the zinc within them
        producting energy that can even power a light blub.</p>

    <p>Lemons contain energy in the form of chemical potential energy stored in their natural acids and sugars. When
        used in a
        simple electrochemical reaction, such as in a lemon battery, the citric acid in lemons helps facilitate the flow
        of
        electrons between two different metals, generating a small electrical current. This process works because the
        acid acts
        as an electrolyte, allowing ions to move freely and complete a circuit. While the energy produced is minimal, it
        demonstrates how lemons can be a natural source of electricity. Additionally, the carbohydrates and vitamins in
        lemons
        provide energy to the human body when consumed, supporting metabolism and overall vitality.
