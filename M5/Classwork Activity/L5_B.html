<!--
Promise:A Promise is a special Javascript object used for asynchronous
operations (e.g., fetching data, waiting for a task to finish). A
promise can be in one of three states:

1. Pending - the initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.

2. Fulfilled - the operation completed successfully.

3. Rejected - the operation failed.

async: The async keyword is used before a function to tell JavaScript
that the function will return a Promise automatically.

await: The await keyword is used inside an async function to wait for
a Promise to finish.
